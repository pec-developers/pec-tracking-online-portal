### 6. UI Description

This section outlines the page-by-page user interface for each role. Components mentioned will be from the Shadcn/ui library.

### 6.0 Common Layout Components

For all authenticated users (Admin, Mentor, Student, etc.), the application will use a consistent master layout which includes a persistent Header and a collapsible Sidebar for navigation.

- **6.0.1 Header**
    - **Description:** A sticky header bar at the top of the viewport.
    - **Components:**
        - **Left Side:** Application Logo and Name ("Student Mentoring App").
        - **Right Side:** `DropdownMenu` triggered by a user `Avatar` component.
            - **Dropdown Content:**
                - `DropdownMenuItem` (non-interactive): Displays the logged-in user's Full Name and Role (e.g., "John Doe - Administrator").
                - `DropdownMenuSeparator`: A horizontal line.
                - `DropdownMenuItem` ("Logout"): A button that logs the user out and redirects them to the Role Selection Page.
- **6.0.2 Sidebar**
    - **Description:** A navigation sidebar for the application. The navigation links displayed will be dynamic based on the logged-in user's role.
    - **Components:**
        - `NavigationMenu`: A vertical list of links.
        - **Administrator Links:** "Dashboard", "User Management", "Student Management", "Mentor Assignment", "Academic Management".
        - **Mentor Links:** "Dashboard" (shows their mentee list), "My Profile".
        - **Student/Parent Links:** "My Profile", "Faculty Contacts".
- **6.0.3 Common Layout Responsive Behavior**
    - **Header:**
        - **Desktop:** Displays the full application name and logo on the left, with the user avatar and dropdown on the right.
        - **Tablet:** Similar to desktop. The application name may be truncated on smaller tablet sizes to save space.
        - **Mobile:** The application name is hidden or shortened. A "hamburger" menu icon appears on the far left to toggle the sidebar. The user avatar remains on the right.
    - **Sidebar:**
        - **Desktop:** The sidebar is visible by default in its expanded state. A toggle button allows the user to collapse it into an icon-only view.
        - **Tablet (Landscape):** Behaves similarly to the desktop view, likely starting in the collapsed (icon-only) state.
        - **Tablet (Portrait) & Mobile:** The sidebar is hidden by default. It appears as an overlay, sliding in from the left, when triggered by the "hamburger" icon in the header. It includes a close button or can be dismissed by tapping the overlay background.
- **6.0.3 Common Responsive Patterns**
    - To ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience, various tables throughout the application will adopt specific responsive behaviors on small screens. These patterns are referenced in the component descriptions below.
    - **Pattern A: Standard Data Table to Card List**
        - **Use Case:** Displaying lists of items like users, students, etc.
        - **Behavior:** On small screens, each table row transforms into a `Card`. Inside the card, data is displayed vertically with `Labels`. This is the default responsive behavior as defined in SRS section 4.1.1.
            - **Desktop & Tablet:** Renders as a standard `Table` with multiple columns and rows, allowing for easy comparison of data across entries.
            - **Mobile:** Transforms into a vertical list of `Card` components. Each card represents a single row from the table. Inside the card, the data is displayed as a series of `Label`-value pairs (e.g., "Name: John Doe", "Role: Mentor"). Action buttons are given prominence for easy tapping.
    - **Pattern B: Two-Column Form Table to Card List**
        - **Use Case:** Simple input tables where each row has a label and a single input/control (e.g., Weekly Activities, Laboratory ratings).
        - **Behavior:** On small screens, the table transforms into a list of cards. Each card represents one row, with the label becoming the `CardTitle` or a prominent `Label`, and the input control (e.g., `Input`, `Select`, `RadioGroup`) placed vertically below it.
            - **Desktop & Tablet:** Renders as a two-column `Table`. The first column contains the descriptive label (e.g., "Academic"), and the second column contains the corresponding `Input`, `Select`, or `RadioGroup` control.
            - **Mobile:** Transforms into a list of `Card` components. Each card represents a single form row. The label becomes the `CardTitle` or a prominent `Label` inside the card, and the input control is placed vertically below it for a clear, tap-friendly layout.
    - **Pattern C: Multi-Column Form Table to Card List**
        - **Use Case:** Complex tables with multiple dynamic columns (e.g., Classroom Activity ratings per subject).
        - **Behavior:** On small screens, the table transforms into a list of cards, where each card represents one *row metric* (e.g., a card for "Attendance"). Inside that card, a vertical list will display each *column header* (e.g., subject name) paired with its corresponding input control.
            - **Desktop & Tablet:** Renders as a full multi-column `Table`. The first column contains the row metric (e.g., "Attendance"), and subsequent columns represent dynamic items (e.g., subjects), with an input control in each cell.
            - **Mobile:** Transforms into a list of `Card` components. Each card represents one *row metric* (e.g., a card for "Attendance"). Inside that card, a vertical list displays each *column header* (e.g., "Subject 1") paired with its corresponding input control, preventing horizontal overflow.
